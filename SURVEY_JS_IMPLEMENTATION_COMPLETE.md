- Detailed result entry forms
- Review and approval workflows

### ✅ 6. User Interface Integration

#### WorkflowDemo Page (`src/pages/WorkflowDemo.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Demonstration and testing interface
- **Features**:
  - Individual workflow testing
  - Flow Manager demonstration
  - Template selection interface
  - Real-time feedback and logging

#### Navigation Integration
- Added "Workflow Demo" to the main navigation

- Located in the "Tools & Settings" section

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Lab Technicians:
1. Navigate to **Workflow Demo** in the sidebar
2. Select **Individual Workflows** tab
3. Choose a workflow template (Basic Lab or CBC Test)
4. Follow the step-by-step Survey.js interface
5. Complete all required fields and validations
6. Submit the workflow for processing

### For Complex Procedures:
1. Navigate to **Workflow Demo** in the sidebar
2. Select **Flow Manager Demo** tab
3. The system automatically selects appropriate workflows based on:
   - Test groups in the order
   - Specific analytes requested
   - Laboratory protocols
4. Complete workflows in the suggested sequence
5. Track progress across all related procedures

### For Administrators:
1. Use the WorkflowConfigurator (integration ready)
2. Create custom workflow templates
3. Assign workflows to specific test groups/analytes
4. Monitor workflow performance and completion rates

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack:
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Survey.js** for dynamic form generation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **React Router** for navigation

### Backend Integration:
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** database
- **Edge Functions** for serverless processing
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live updates
- **Row Level Security** for data protection

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Create workflows without coding
- **Real-time Validation**: Instant feedback on data entry
- **Conditional Logic**: Show/hide fields based on responses
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all workflow events
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on tablets and mobile devices

## 📊 System Benefits

### For Laboratory Operations:

# Workflow System Setup and Testing Guide

This guide explains how to set up and test the Survey.js workflow system that's now integrated with your database.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup

Your workflow is already in the database, but you may need to run the migration for result processing:

```sql
-- Run this migration in your Supabase SQL editor
\i 'supabase/migrations/20250911_workflow_results_tables.sql'
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Optional: Survey.js license key to remove branding
VITE_SURVEYJS_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key
```

### 3. Deploy Edge Function

Deploy the workflow result processing function:

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy process-workflow-result
```

### 4. Access the Workflow

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/workflow-demo**
3. Your "Peripheral Smear Examination" workflow should appear in the dropdown

## üß™ Testing Your Workflow

### Step 1: Navigate to Workflow Demo
- Go to the main navigation
- Click on **"Workflow Demo"** (under Tools & Settings)

### Step 2: Select Your Workflow
- In the **"Individual Workflows"** tab
- Select **"Peripheral Smear Examination"** from the dropdown
- Click **"Start Workflow"**

### Step 3: Complete the Workflow Steps

Your workflow has 3 steps:

1. **Step 1: Smear Preparation**
   - Enter smear quality (Good/Poor)

2. **Step 2: Microscopic Examination**
   - Enter microscopic observations

3. **Step 3: Report**
   - Enter final report notes

### Step 4: View Results
- Data is logged to browser console
- Database records are created in:
  - `workflow_step_events` (audit trail)
  - `order_workflow_instances` (progress tracking)
  - `test_results` (if measurements entered)

## üìä What Happens Behind the Scenes

### Database Operations
1. **Workflow Instance Created**: New record in `order_workflow_instances`
2. **Step Events Logged**: Each step completion logged in `workflow_step_events`
3. **Progress Tracked**: Step completion status updated in real-time
4. **Results Processed**: Lab data stored in appropriate tables

### API Calls
1. **getWorkflows()**: Fetches available workflows from database
2. **startWorkflow()**: Creates new workflow instance
3. **logEvent()**: Records step completion events
4. **completeWorkflow()**: Marks workflow as complete
5. **Edge Function**: Processes results and updates related tables

## üîß Customizing Your Workflow

### Adding Fields
Your workflow definition is stored as JSON in the database. To add fields:

1. Access your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to **Table Editor** ‚Üí **workflow_versions**
3. Find your workflow definition
4. Edit the JSON in the `definition` column

### Example: Adding a dropdown field
```json
{
  "name": "cell_count",
  "type": "dropdown",
  "title": "White Blood Cell Count",
  "choices": [
    {"value": "normal", "text": "Normal (4,000-11,000)"},
    {"value": "low", "text": "Low (<4,000)"},
    {"value": "high", "text": "High (>11,000)"}
  ]
}
```

### Supported Field Types
- `text`: Text input
- `comment`: Textarea
- `dropdown`: Select dropdown
- `radiogroup`: Radio buttons
- `checkbox`: Checkboxes
- `html`: Static HTML content

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### View Workflow Activity
```sql
-- Recent workflow completions
SELECT 
  owi.id,
  owi.order_id,
  wd.name as workflow_name,
  owi.status,
  owi.started_at,
  owi.completed_at
FROM order_workflow_instances owi
JOIN workflow_versions wv ON owi.workflow_version_id = wv.id
JOIN workflow_definitions wd ON wv.workflow_id = wd.id
ORDER BY owi.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### View Step Events
```sql
-- Recent workflow events
SELECT 
  wse.created_at,
  wse.event_type,
  wse.step_id,
  wse.event_data
FROM workflow_step_events wse
ORDER BY wse.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

### 2. Edge Functions
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy process-workflow-result
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Set production environment variables in your hosting platform.

### 4. Survey.js License (Optional)
For production, consider getting a Survey.js license to remove branding:
```javascript
// Add to your app initialization
Survey.settings.licenseKey = "your-license-key";
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Appearing
- Check database connection
- Verify workflow has `active: true`
- Check browser console for errors

### Step Not Saving
- Check authentication (user must be logged in)
- Verify Edge Function is deployed
- Check Supabase logs for errors

### Data Not Appearing in Database
- Check RLS policies
- Verify user permissions
- Check Edge Function logs

## üìû Support

The workflow system is now fully functional and integrated with your LIMS. Your "Peripheral Smear Examination" workflow should work immediately after following this setup guide.
